# Titanic
I love waking up, not knowing what where I'll wind up.
One night I'm sleeping under a bridge.
Now I'm on the grandest ship in Life's a gift.
I don't intend on wasting it.
You never know what hand you'll get dealt.
You take life as it comes at you.
Make each day count.
To making it count.
To making it count.
